Meeting Minutes – Jerome (Chun) 

25/2/2022 

Every meeting, a new person will write the minutes. For the first meeting, Jerome will write them. We will also have a daily standup through whatsapp.  

What we talked about in meeting: 
    Discussing the spec with group so everyone is on the same page about the project. Aaleen share screened and discussed all functions.  

Our understanding of the project so far: 
    -Auth register should go first, Auth login next, All channels, Clear 
    -Setting deadlines, Deciding who should do which functions  
    -Clear seems like the hardest one, think it empties all stored data, resetting it  
    -Confused about channel invite and channel join  

Issues Board: For every function
