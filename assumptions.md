General Assumption: 
We are returning dictionaries instead of just the return value. For example, instead of just returning chanel_id, we would return {'channel_id': channel_i}, where there is a key in front of the return value that describes what the return value is. 

channel_details:
a channel's details will be returned, regardless of whether the channel is public or private
