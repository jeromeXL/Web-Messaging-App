# Web Messaging Application

To manage the transition from trimesters to hexamesters in 2021, UNSW has established a new focus on building an in-house digital collaboration and communication tool for groups and teams to support the high intensity learning environment.
Rather than re-invent the wheel, UNSW has decided that it finds the functionality of Microsoft Teams to be nearly exactly what it needs. For this reason, UNSW has contracted out Penguin Pty Ltd (a small software business run by Jake) to build the new product. In UNSW's attempt to try to bring people together in this digital age, they have named their UNSW-based product ðŸ§µUNSW SeamsðŸ§¶ (or just Seams for short). UNSW Seams is the questionably-named seamingly thread-less communication tool that allows you to share, communication, and collaborate virtually.
Penguin Pty Ltd has sub-contracted two software firms:

BlueBottle Pty Ltd (two software developers, Andrea and Andrew, who will build the initial web-based GUI)
YourTeam Pty Ltd (a team of talented misfits completing COMP1531 in 22T1), who will build the backend Python server

In summary, UNSW contracts Penguin Pty Ltd, who sub contracts:

BlueBottle (Andrea and Andrew) for frontend work
YourTeam (you and others) for backend work

Penguin Pty Ltd met with Andrea and Andrew (the frontend development team) 2 weeks ago to brief them on this project. While you are still trying to get up to speed on the requirements of this project, Andrea and Andrew understand the requirements of the project very well.
Because of this they have already specified a common interface for the frontend and backend to operate on. This allows both parties to go off and do their own development and testing under the assumption that both parties will comply with the common interface. This is the interface you are required to use.
The specific capabilities that need to be built for this project are described in the interface at the bottom. This is clearly a lot of features, but not all of them are to be implemented at once.
